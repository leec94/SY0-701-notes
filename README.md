### General security concepts

### Threats, vulnerability, and mitigations
### Security architecture
### Security operations
Types of web filters:
- Agent-based web filters: installed directly on the end-user's device, ensuring that the filtering policy is enforced consistently, whether the user is on the corporate network or working remotely \[[Ref](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-701/sy0-701-video/web-filtering-sy0-701/)\]
- Web security gateway filters: or Unified Threat Management (UTM) device, is a device that filters unsafe content from web traffic, and block risky or unauthorized user behavior. Contains URL filtering, anti-malware detection and blocking, and application control. Runs on proxy servers or on-prem or in the cloud. \[[Ref](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-secure-web-gateway/)\]

Network Access Control: enforces policies that determine which devices are allowed to access the network, and what resources they can access once they're connected \[[Ref](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-501/network-access-control-4/)\]
- Agent-based NAC: requires an agent to be installed on every device. Is able to get more detailed information about the device requesting access to the network, and provides continuous monitoring \[[Ref](https://s3msecurity.com/agent-based-or-agentless-which-should-be-preferred/)\]
- Agentless NAC: does not require installation of agents on devices, typically relies on network level authentication protocols such as 802.1X to authenticate devices and enforce access policies. May be less effective at enforcing security policies
