### General security concepts
Concealment types
- Tokenization: the process of substituting a sensitive data element with a non-sensitive equivalent, referred to as a token. The token and the data it substitutes are stored in a secure database. If the original data is needed, it can be accessed using the token and querying the database. The token will be a different size and have a different structure than the original data so the token can’t be used to decipher the original data.
- Steganography: the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video
- Data masking: a method to de-identify some or all characters in a sequence, but not changing the total number of characters that a field should contain. The masked version will be structurally the same, but the data will be hidden. Data that is masked will have the same number of characters as the original data, not a smaller set. _Example:_ Changing the letters or numbers entered into a password field with dots is an example of data masking. 
- Encryption: the process of converting information or data into a code to prevent unauthorized access. It often uses an algorithm to replace the original data with other data. If a person figures out or acquires the algorithm, the data can be decrypted

Security Controls \[[Ref](https://purplesec.us/learn/security-controls/)\]
- Technical: use technology to reduce vulnerabilities in hardware and software
- Administrative: policies, procedures, or guidelines that define personnel or business practices in accordance with the organization’s security goals
- Physical: implementation of security measures in a defined structure used to deter or prevent unauthorized access to sensitive material
- Preventative: attempt to prevent an incident from occurring
- Detective: attempt to detect incidents after they have occurred
- Corrective: attempt to reverse the impact of an incident
- Deterrent: attempt to discourage individuals from causing an incident
- Compensating: alternative controls used when a primary control is not feasible
- Directive: ensure consistent behavior within an organization

Access Controls
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): an authorization model that assigns permissions to roles, rather than individual users
- Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC): determines access through a combination of contexts and system wide attributes
- Discretionary Access Control (DAC): an authorization model where the owner of the resource decides who is allowed to access it
- Mandatory Access Control (MAC): an authorization model where access to resources is determined by a set of rules defined by a central authority. The system determines access authorization based on the security labels applied to objects and the clearance levels assigned to users. The system enforces these rules to ensure that users can only access objects for which they have the appropriate clearance. The system administrator may configure the security policies and labels but does not directly control individual access decisions, which are enforced by the system according to the MAC rules.

Zero trust concepts
- Policy administrator: responsible for defining and managing security policies that dictate access controls
- Authentication server: primarily tasked with validating a user's credentials and ensuring that a user is who they claim to be
- Policy enforcement point: responsible for enforcing the access control decisions made by the policy engine

Certificates
- Certificate stapling: attaches an OCSP validation to the digital certificate, saving the client and server the time of repeatedly querying the OCSP server for certificate validity
- Certificate pinning: a technique used to prevent changes in the valid certificate for a domain
- Certificate chaining: used to delegate authority to subordinate certificate authorities
- Cross-certificate trust model: a reciprocal trust, where each of two different root CAs trusts the certificates that have been generated by the other root CA
- Certificate authority (CA): trusted third party that issues digital certificates
- Mesh model: not only are the other root CAs trusted but also their subordinates, or intermediate CAs
- Hierarchical model: has a root and subordinate CAs
- Subordinate: a lower-level CA in a hierarchical model
- Registration Authority (RA): requests identifying information from the user and forwards certificate requests up to the CA to create a digital certificate
- Domain validation certificates (DV): provide a lower level of assurance, as they only verify that the applicant has control over the domain
- Organization validation certificates (OV): offer a moderate level of assurance, verifying the organization's identity in addition to domain control
- Extended validation certificates (EV): offer the highest possible level of assurance that a certificate authority has verified the identity of the certificate subject

Hashing Algorithms 
- MD5: produces a 128-bit hash
- SHA-1: produces a 160-bit hash

Encryption Algorithms
- AES: symmetric encryption algorithm
- RSA: asymmetric encryption algorithm

### Threats, vulnerability, and mitigations
Malware types
- Logic bomb: executes a malicious action when a specific condition or trigger is met, such as a date, time, or event
- Ransomware: encrypts the data or files on a system and demands a ransom for their decryption or restoration
- Trojan: disguises itself as a legitimate or benign program, but performs malicious actions when executed.
- Worm: self-replicates and spreads to other systems or networks without user interaction
- Fileless Malware: characterized by its evasion techniques, utilizing legitimate system processes and tools, and running directly in memory without writing files to the disk. 
- Rootkit: aim to provide unauthorized access to a computer or areas of its software.
- Adware: primarily focuses on delivering unwanted advertisements to users. 

Password attacks
- Password Spraying: trying common passwords against multiple accounts, hoping to find a match
- Brute force: involves trying all possible combinations of characters until the correct password is found
- Dictionary: using a precompiled list of possible passwords, typically applied to one user account
- Rainbow Table: precomputed tables of hash values to quickly reverse cryptographic hash functions, targeting stored hashed passwords

Cryptographic attacks
- Birthday attack: type of cryptographic attack that involves finding two different inputs that produce the same output for a hashing algorithm
- Downgrade attack: forcing a communication channel to use a weaker encryption algorithm or protocol, making it easier to decrypt or intercept

DDoS Attacks
- Amplified DDoS: attackers can send a small request to a server, prompting it to reply with a much larger response. The attacker uses a forged source IP (the victim's IP), causing the server's amplified response to flood the victim
- Reflected DDoS: the attacker sends requests to third-party servers with a forged source IP address (the victim's IP), causing those servers to send responses to the victim

Network Attacks
- ARP poisoning: an attack that involves sending false MAC address information to a network switch, causing the switch to associate the incorrect MAC address with a particular IP address
- DNS poisoning: an attack that involves manipulating the DNS server to redirect traffic to malicious sites
- on-path attack: involves intercepting and potentially altering communication between two parties
- Disassociation attacks: intentionally disconnect a wireless user from their access point to force a reauthentication that the attacker may collect with a wireless eavesdropping tool

Wireless Attacks
- evil twin: the correct term used to refer to a seemingly identical, legitimate access point that an attacker has set up to cause unsuspecting users to attempt a wireless connection

Web Attacks
- SQL injection: used to input database commands into an application
- Cross-site scripting (XSS): attempts to inject client-side code into a server so it will be sent to, and executed on, other clients
- Cross-site request forgery (XSRF): exploits applications that use cookies to authenticate users and track sessions. In this type of attack, a victim is tricked into performing unwanted actions on a web application in which they're authenticated, without the victim necessarily having to click a link. The attacker sends an HTTP request to the victim's browser, spoofing an action on the target site, such as changing account settings. 
- Session hijacking: involves taking over a user's session, typically by obtaining their session cookie. While it can result in unauthorized changes, it doesn't typically involve the victim being on an external site before the unexpected change
- Session token prediction: focuses on identifying potential weaknesses in the generation of session tokens. If an attacker can predict the session token, they can take over a session. This type of attack is more about guessing session values rather than inducing unintended changes on behalf of authenticated users.
- XML injection: used to input XML code into an application to manipulate how the application works
- LDAP injection: an attack that can send malicious data to a web form that in turn makes calls or queries to a directory database, such as an X.500-compliant database like Active Directory, or to any other LDAP database.
- Directory traversal attack: enables a malicious user to inject commands inside the HTTP message in order to travel through the directory structure of the web server

Phishing
- Pharming attack: the victim was redirected to an illegitimate site that mimicked the corporate site and stole the victim's credentials. Pharming involves manipulating DNS entries or exploiting vulnerabilities to redirect users to fraudulent websites without their knowledge
- Phishing: sending deceptive communications, usually emails, to trick individuals into disclosing personal information, but it typically involves direct solicitation
- Whaling: type of phishing attack that targets high-profile individuals, such as executives, and also typically involves direct solicitation
- Watering hole attack: involves compromising a legitimate website that the target is known to visit, and then using it to deliver malware or capture information


Backup types
- Image backup: duplicates an OS installation, either from a physical hard disk or a VM's virtual hard disk. It offers a quick means to redeploy the system without reinstalling software and settings
- File-level backup: copies individual files and directories
- Incremental backup: saves only the changes made since the last backup
- Differential backup: saves all changes made since the last full backup

Attributes of threat actors
- Capability: a threat actor's proficiency in devising new exploit techniques and tools. It can range from using commonly found attack tools to creating zero-day exploits in various systems. Those with the highest capabilities can even deploy non-cyber tools, such as political or military assets
- Sophistication: the level of intricacy and advancement of a threat actor's methods and tools

CVE
- CVSS Scoring: CVSS scores are calculated using a formula that provides a numerical result but also include the categories of Low, Medium, High, and Critical. Low is anything that results in a score of less than 4.0. Medium is a score of 4-6.9. High is 7.0-8.9. Critical is a score higher than 9.

Pen test tools 
- FakeAP: FakeAP is a Linux-based program that broadcasts false SSIDs to effect a denial of service attack on wireless networks
- Metasploit: an exploitation framework that comes with a number of different exploits to attack different types of systems
- Sn1per: a tool that automates a scan of a system and identifies vulnerabilities that exist on that system
- hping: a ping program that allows you to customize the protocol used and the port used to perform the ping
- netcat: a program used to open a port on a system or connect to an open port on another system

### Security architecture
- Proxy server: stands between the user's computer and the internet, intercepting requests and potentially reducing the public-facing attack surface by masking the internal server
- Jump server: used as a bridge to connect to other servers or networks in separate security zones
- Real-time Operating System (RTOS): an operating system where the processes running are deterministic and prioritize performance, used on devices like industrial equipment and automobiles. \[[Ref](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-501/embedded-systems/)\]

Security systems
- Web application firewall (WAF): Focuses on inspecting HTTP traffic, prevents common web application attacks like cross-site scripting and SQL injections
  - can be placed "In-line" or "Out of Band"
  - WAF vs NGFW article \[[Ref](https://www.f5.com/c/landing/waf-vs-ngfw-which-technology-do-you-need)\] 
- Data loss prevention (DLP) system: software or hardware system that aims to monitor data in use, in transit, or at rest to detect and prevent data theft, or being leaked.  DLP can be implemented to monitor network traffic and to identify sensitive information being sent through instant messenger, e-mail, or protocols such as HTTP and FTP. DLP can also analyze data in storage to ensure sensitive information is not being stored in the wrong location. 
  - Types: Endpoint, Network, Storage, Cloud based 
- Intrusion detection system (IDS): logs or alerts if found something suspicious or malicious. Signature-based (from defined signatures) or anomaly based (from baseline)
- Intrusion prevention system (IPS): logs, alerts and takes actions when finds something suspicious or malicious.  

Networking 
- Physical isolation: network design that involves using air-gapping, disconnecting cables, or locking devices to prevent unauthorized access or interference. It can offer benefits such as security, privacy, and reliability.
- Logical segmentation: network design that involves dividing a network into smaller segments to improve performance and security
- Security zones: used to segregate networks to protect private networks from public ones such as the Internet, examples include extranets and DMZs  
- Virtual LANs (VLANs): used to segment hosts into logical networks and to create secure communication boundaries between them. VLANs are implemented on switches
- Software-defined networking (SDN): a network technology that involves dynamically configuring and managing network devices and services through software
- Decentralization: network design that involves distributing the control and authority among multiple nodes or entities
- Port security: feature of managed network switches that allows an organization to limit which devices can connect to a network based on their physical addresses (MAC addresses)
- Secure Access Service Edge (SASE): a cloud-based solution that integrates network security and WAN capabilities
- Software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN): provides centralized network management, flexible routing, and traffic management capabilities. It can be hosted both on-premises and in the cloud, giving it an edge for comprehensive WAN optimization 

VPNs
- TLS VPNs: least susceptible to firewall interference because they typically use port 443, which is the same port used for HTTPS web traffic. This port is commonly allowed full outbound access through firewalls, making it more likely that the VPN connection will be successful
- IPSec VPNs: use UDP port 500 as well as IP protocols 50 (ESP) and 51 (AH), which are more likely to be blocked by firewalls at customer sites
- Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP): an obsolete method for implementing virtual private networks.
- Layer 2 Tunnel Protocol (L2TP) VPN: a tunneling protocol, often used to support VPNs, which encapsulates data for secure transmission over public networks. While it doesn’t encrypt data on its own, it’s often paired with encryption protocols like IPSec. \[[Ref](https://nordlayer.com/learn/vpn/l2tp/)\]

Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID)
- Striping: spreads the data  for a single volume across 2 or more drives 
- Parity: Calculation of data across two drives, and stored on a third. If a drive fails, the RAID controller can rebuilt from other 2 drives
	- Dedicated parity: parity information is stored all on a single drive
	- Distributed parity: spreads data across all drives in the array
- Mirrored (or redundancy): 2 or more drives each with a copy of the drive, so the volume is protected from a drive failure, only one drive needed to work to function normally

|         | Stripe | Mirrored | Parity             | Minimum Drives |
|---------|--------|----------|--------------------|----------------|
| RAID 0  | yes    | no       | no                 | 2              |
| RAID 1  | no     | yes      | no                 | 2              |
| RAID 5  | yes    | no       | yes, distributed   | 3              |
| RAID 6  | yes    | no       | yes, 2 distributed | 4              |
| RAID 10 | yes    | yes      | no                 | 4              |

Authentication
- Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP): framework for various authentication methods
- Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP): used to encapsulate EAP messages over a secure tunnel that uses Transport Layer Security (TLS), mutual authentication using server certificates, and uses Active Directory databases to authenticate a password from the client
- EAP-TTLS: Requires a digital certificate on the server, but not on the client. Client uses a password for authentication
- EAP-TLS: uses public key infrastructure with a digital certificate installed on both the client and server, uses mutual authentication
- EAP-MD5: uses simple passwords and challenge handshake authentication process to provide remote access authentication
- EAP-FAST: Uses a protected access credential instead of a certificate to establish mutual authentication
- EAP-LEAP: Cisco proprietary and limited to Cisco devices 

SSL Transaction Steps
1. The client sends a request for a web page to the secure web site by using https:// in the URL. This makes a connection to port 443 by default.
2. The server sends the public key to the client.
3. The client validates the certificate and ensures it has not expired or been revoked.
4. The client creates a random symmetric key (known as a session key) used to encrypt the web page content, and then encrypts the symmetric key with the public key obtained from the web server.
5. The encrypted information is sent to the web server. The web server decrypts and obtains the symmetric key (session key). The web server uses the symmetric key to encrypt information between the client and the server.

Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) \[[Ref](https://securityscorecard.com/blog/what-is-dnssec-and-why-is-it-important)\]
- DNSSEC: Adds authentication to DNS response
- DNSKEY record: should contain the public key that corresponds to the private key used to sign the records
- the records would be signed with the organization’s private key and should be verified with the organization’s public key

### Security operations
Types of web filters
- Agent-based web filters: installed directly on the end-user's device, ensuring that the filtering policy is enforced consistently, whether the user is on the corporate network or working remotely \[[Ref](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-701/sy0-701-video/web-filtering-sy0-701/)\]
- Web security gateway filters: or Unified Threat Management (UTM) device, is a device that filters unsafe content from web traffic, and block risky or unauthorized user behavior. Contains URL filtering, anti-malware detection and blocking, and application control. Also has featues such as firewall, intrusion prevention, and antivirus. Runs on proxy servers or on-prem or in the cloud. \[[Ref](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-secure-web-gateway/)\]

Network Access Control (NAC): enforces policies that determine which devices are allowed to access the network, and what resources they can access once they're connected \[[Ref](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-501/network-access-control-4/)\]
- Agent-based NAC: requires an agent to be installed on every device. Is able to get more detailed information about the device requesting access to the network, and provides continuous monitoring \[[Ref](https://s3msecurity.com/agent-based-or-agentless-which-should-be-preferred/)\]
- Agentless NAC: does not require installation of agents on devices, typically relies on network level authentication protocols such as 802.1X to authenticate devices and enforce access policies. May be less effective at enforcing security policies 

Features of Next Generation Firewall (NGFW) 
- application awareness that can distinguish between different types of traffic
- can conduct deep packet inspection and use signature-based intrusion detection

- Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS): push button feature on routers that allows you to easily and quickly connect devices to your Wi-Fi network without manually entering the network name (SSID) or password. Not secure and not recommended  

Wireless Protocols 
- **AES**: the most secure and widely adopted encryption protocol for wireless networks. Its strong encryption algorithms and extensive testing demonstrate its effectiveness against various attacks. AES is the recommended choice for ensuring robust security in wireless communication
- WEP: outdated encryption protocol that has been widely exploited and rendered highly insecure. Its weak key management and static keys make it vulnerable to various attacks, and it can be cracked relatively easily. It should be avoided in modern network environments due to its lack of security. It has a weak implementation of 24-bit initialization vector (IV), so is vulnerable to IV attacks. 
- TKIP: considered weak and has known vulnerabilities. Due to its security limitations, using TKIP is not advisable, especially when more secure alternatives like AES are available. Used by WPA to rapidly cycle encryption keys and overcome the weaknesses of WEP
- WPA: has some known vulnerabilities, particularly when using its pre-shared key (PSK) mode. Depending solely on WPA might not provide the level of security required to safeguard modern wireless networks. Uses TKIP to rapidly cycle encryption keys and overcome the weaknesses of WEP
- WPA2: Uses Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP) to provide enhanced security using AES
- Transport Layer Security (TLS): a protocol that encrypts communications over a network
- **WPA3** features
  - latest and most secure wireless security protocol
  - utilizes a Diffie-Hellman key agreement
  - provides individualized data encryption even in open networks
  - it prevents eavesdropping, forging, and tampering with management frames
  - uses Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)

- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): the maximum amount of **data** that an organization can afford to lose during a disruption. It represents the point in time to which data must be recovered after recovery efforts are initiated
- Mean Time to Repair (MTTR): the average time it takes to restore a failed system or component to a working state after a disruption. It measures the efficiency of the repair process
- Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF): the average time elapsed between two consecutive failures of a system or component. It provides an indication of the system's reliability and uptime

Risk Types

- Strategic: the risk that an organization will become less effective in meeting its major goals and objectives as a result of the breach
- Reputational: when the negative publicity surrounding a security breach causes the loss of goodwill among customers, employees, suppliers, and other stakeholders
- Operational: risk to the organization's ability to carry out its day-to-day functions
- Compliance: occurs when a security breach causes an organization to run afoul of legal or regulatory requirements

Quantitative Risk Analysis 
- Asset Value (AV): financial value of the asset
- Exposure Factor (EF): the percentage of the asset value that is expected to be lost if a specific risk event occurs
- Single Loss Expectancy (SLE): AV * EF, the monetary loss expected from a single occurrence of a risk event, which includes considerations like downtime and associated costs. 
- Annualized Rate of Occurence (ARO): frequency of threat occurrence within a year, x number of times​
- Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE): SLE * ARO, calculating the overall expected annual loss in value ($) by considering both the frequency and impact of risk events, but it encompasses more than just a single even


- Risk appetite: the amount of risk an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives. It's essentially a strategic, high-level view that aligns with the organization's goals and priorities. Think of it as the maximum amount of risk an organization is ready to take on overall, considering its strategic objectives and mission. Risk appetite is about the broader, overarching risk the organization is willing to accept to achieve its strategic goals.
- Risk tolerance: more specific and operational. It represents the acceptable level of risk exposure for various activities or projects within the organization. Risk tolerance is about the specific, measurable levels of risk acceptable in various situations. Risk tolerance refers more broadly to an organization's or individual's willingness to take on risk, not the specific predefined level for taking action. 
- Risk threshold: the limit of acceptable risk that an organization establishes, which once exceeded, triggers a response to reduce the risk to an acceptable level
- Risk level: the severity or high/low ranking of risk
- Risk rating: incorporates both likelihood and impact to give an overall score to a risk
- Likelihood: used in qualitative risk analysis to subjectively describe how probable a risk event is, often expressed in terms such as "low," "medium," or "high."
